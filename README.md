# Programmable digital PLL testbench

I built a programmable timing circuit checker because I wanted to learn how a small program could control a circuit and check its results. The circuit compares two repeating signals and adjusts a control value when they drift apart. A small processor changes its settings, and a queue holds the results until the program reads them.

I can run the checks below to see whether a circuit change loses a sample, makes a wrong calculation, or takes the wrong instruction after a branch. The checks compare the hardware with separate Python models. They also try deliberate faults so I can tell whether the checkers catch mistakes.

## Try it

I use Python 3.10 or newer, Verilator 5.036 or newer, Yosys and a C++ compiler. On macOS:

```sh
brew install verilator yosys
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest -q
python scripts/report.py
yosys -c scripts/synth.tcl
```

The report at `build/report.json` gives a pass/fail result and counts the required coverage cases. A failing simulation, missing case, duplicate result or missing random seed makes the report fail. Compiler output stays in `build/report.log`.

The Linux checks also run automatically in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/jackaI1/pll-verification-testbench/actions). Each architecture run provides a downloadable `verification-evidence` artifact containing instruction-test results, formal counterexamples and timing reports. I do not need a container or a virtual machine to run the local checks.

## What the program controls

The phase-locked loop (PLL) model compares a reference pulse with a divided clock pulse. Its digital controller raises or lowers a four-bit value, and marks the signals as locked after four matching pulses. It models the digital decisions, rather than an analog oscillator or real clock jitter.

The processor can change the divider, hold the PLL in reset and capture status words. A first-in, first-out queue (FIFO) preserves the order of those words. My integration test runs firmware that sweeps divider ratios 2 through 8, captures three samples at each setting and reads all 21 samples back into memory. A Python PLL model checks the status values and the test checks every copied sample.

## Circuit and processor design

`rtl/sample_fifo.sv` is a parameterized sample queue. I test depths 1, 3 and 8 with three repeatable random seeds. A Python queue is the reference; seven required cases cover empty reads, full writes, simultaneous reads and writes, pointer wraparound, empty/full states and reset with queued data. SystemVerilog assertions check occupancy, pointer bounds and rejected operations.

`rtl/rv32_core.sv` implements the RV32I integer instructions in five stages: fetch, decode, execute, memory and writeback. Forwarding sends a result straight to the next instruction that needs it. A one-cycle stall handles a load dependency, and a taken branch discards younger instructions. Both the original ripple-carry adder and the carry-select version run against the same Python instruction model.

The public `riscv-tests` RV32UI instruction suite runs in Verilator using a small bare-metal adapter. The upstream instruction bodies stay unchanged, including the misaligned-data and instruction-fence tests. This is an educational bare-metal core: it has no interrupts, privileged mode, cache, bus wait states or operating-system support. Its memory adapter supplies a four-byte window starting at the requested byte address, including unaligned addresses. See [the design notes](docs/design.md) for ports, memory addresses and reproduction commands.

## Formal checks and timing

SymbiYosys explores arbitrary instruction and memory inputs to check x0, program-counter updates, pipeline flushes, load stalls and forwarding priority. CI runs bounded checking, induction and reachability checks. A deliberately broken flush must fail with a replayable counterexample. These are local pipeline properties, not a formal proof of every instruction or full RISC-V compliance.

I retain `FAST_ALU=0` as the original serial-carry timing baseline. `FAST_ALU=1` uses four-bit carry-select groups, calculating both possible carry inputs before selecting a result. CI maps both complete cores to the same Sky130 standard cells with Yosys, then measures their longest constrained paths with OpenSTA. The comparison uses identical clock, input, output and load constraints and fails unless the measured path gets shorter. This is cell-based timing before placement, with no extracted wire delays. [Measured reports](docs/evidence/) record the actual before and after result.

## Regression details

The existing PLL driver, monitor and scoreboard use cocotb and pyuvm. They check the correct controller and a deliberately faulty divider and require all 11 PLL coverage bins. The new FIFO regression requires all seven cases in each of nine depth/seed runs. Processor tests compare retired instructions with a sequential model for three seeds on both adder versions. GitHub Actions runs the full checks on every push; simulation and synthesis also run on pull requests. Generated reports are artifacts rather than hand-written pass flags.
